# Intelligent Surveillance & Rescue UAV

An edge AI-based autonomous drone system designed to operate in GPS-denied environments for surveillance and rescue missions.

---

## Problem Statement
Drones rely heavily on GPS for navigation and stable communication. In disaster zones, dense urban areas, or signal-contested environments, GPS becomes unreliable, reducing mission effectiveness.

---

## Proposed Solution
This project develops a self-reliant UAV system that uses:
- Visual-based navigation
- Onboard AI inference
- Sensor fusion (Camera + IMU)
- Edge-first processing
- Autonomous decision-making

---

## System Architecture
- Edge AI Processing Unit
- Stereo Vision / Camera
- Visual SLAM Localization
- PX4 Flight Controller
- MAVLink Communication
- Ground Monitoring Station

---

## Technology Stack
- ROS2
- PX4
- MAVLink
- Computer Vision
- Visual SLAM
- Edge AI Inference

---

## Project Status
Conceptual Architecture + System Design Phase  
Prototype under development.
